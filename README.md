# Maze-Game

I created an engine for generating explorable worlds. Users are able to explore and interact with the world I created! 
This project required me to:
- Work through every stage of development from ideation to presentation. 
- Handle large pieces of code and emulated something like a product development cycle. 
- Explore, experiment, and search the web for efficient implementations and ideas that are better than others.
